## Tide harmonics database

A public collection of harmonic constituents from around the world. Work in progress.

**All** constituent data is delivered in Meters.

Much effort has been made to cover the [requirements from libTCD](https://flaterco.com/xtide/libtcd.html).

## Submitting data

If you have **at least a year** of hourly water level observations, you can convert those to harmonic constituents and [submit them to this database online](https://neaps.js.org/harmonics) with a simple form.

Your submission will be automatically converted to a Pull Request to this repository.
